      <description>At SugarCRM, we are deploying Vagrant stacks as part of the DevOps Initiative. How ever we ran into a few problems with defining shares. Since no two engineers work the same or have the same setup we couldn&#39;t define shares that were hard coded in the Vagrantfile. We had to come up with a way to do shares that end user could customize easily. While looking for solutions someone pointed out that the Vagrantfile is just Ruby and we could use YAML to define the shares.</description>
